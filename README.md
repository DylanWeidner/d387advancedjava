# D387 Advanced Java
This is my final project for this class. It is a small website with a JAVA spring boot backend, and an angular frontend. 
It is a website that showcases useage of date transformation using builtin JAVA functionality.
It also includes a docker file that can generate a docker image to run on docker. 
For this class I had to run the file on a docker instance on an Azure server instance which this was able to do.
